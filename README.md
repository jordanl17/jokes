# Jordan's Healthera Challenge

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This starts an express server on port 8050; and opens a React app on port 3000

### `cd server > npm test`

Runs a suite of Jest tests - note that fileService.test.js is incomplete due to complexities with mocking the returned file's contents
